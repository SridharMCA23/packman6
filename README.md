# packman6  
discription:This HTML code defines a webpage that allows users to add PacMan images to the screen and start a simple PacMan-like game. There are two buttons: "Add PacMan" to add PacMan images to the screen and "Start Game" to animate their movement. The JavaScript code controls the creation and movement of PacMan images. The create() function generates a PacMan image at a random position with a random velocity. The move() function animates the PacMan's movement, making them appear as if they are moving on the screen. It switches between PacMan images to create a basic animation effect. The positions, velocities, and directions of the PacMen are stored in arrays, and their properties are updated accordingly during the animation. The move() function uses setTimeout to create a continuous movement effect with a 100ms delay between updates.
